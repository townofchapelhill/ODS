# Git-Clone-Automation
Utility for cloning Github repos quickly.

Dependencies:
Inquirer (https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
git-clone (https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-clone)


This program takes user input for a github username, a repository name, and allows the user to specify a directory where the clone will be copied. 

Future Plans: Automatic pulls from Github based on whether or not the particular branch has been updated.
